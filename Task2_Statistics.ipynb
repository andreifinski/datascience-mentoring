We can choose a random sample of 60 votes from the entire population, but there is some chance that the random sample will be poorly balanced between these cities and, therefore, will be biased and of little use (\"average temperature in the hospital\"), causing a significant error in the estimation. Instead, if we choose to use a simple random sample of 10, 20 and 30 votes from cities A, B and C, respectively, we can get a smaller error in the estimate with the same total sample size.
